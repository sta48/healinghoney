# Project 2, Milestone 1 Feedback

NetID: sta48

Milestone 1 is graded for a **completion grade _by section_**. This is a feedback milestone. If you tried to complete it, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that section**. If a section is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. **There is no partial credit within a specific section.**

We provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. Our feedback is designed to help you learn more; our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). **Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you get, you are responsible for meeting all of the project's requirements for the final submission.**
