# Project 2: Design Journey

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in VS Code's Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it.

## Catalog (Milestone 1)

### Describe your Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your collection be about? What types of attributes will you keep track of for the *things* in your catalog? 1-2 sentences.


### Target Audience(s) (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your target audience(s).


### Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
> Review some existing catalog that are similar to yours. List the catalog's you reviewed here. Write a small reflection on how you might use the design patterns you identified in your review in your own catalog.


## Design & Planning (Milestone 2)

## Design Process (Milestone 2)
> Document your design process. Show us the evolution of your design from your first idea (sketch) to design you wish to implement (sketch). Show us the process you used to organize content and plan the navigation, if applicable.
> Label all images. All labels must be visible in VS Code's Markdown Preview.
> Clearly label the final design.


## Partials (Milestone 2)
> If you have any partials, plan them here.


## Database Schema (Milestone 2)
> Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this. Make sure you include constraints for each field.

Table: movies
- field 1: description..., constraints...
- field...


## Database Query Plan (Milestone 2)
> Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.]

1. All records

    ```
    TODO
    ```

2. Search records

    ```
    TODO
    ```

3. Insert record

    ```
    TODO
    ```


## Code Planning (Milestone 2)
> Plan any PHP code you'll need here.


# Reflection (Final Submission)
> Take this time to reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved since Project 1? What things did you have trouble with?
