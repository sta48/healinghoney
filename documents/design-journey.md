## Catalog (Milestone 1)

### Describe your Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your collection be about? What types of attributes will you keep track of for the *things* in your catalog? 1-2 sentences.

My collection will be a collection of plants and trees that have medicinal properties. Attributes such as plant type, leaf type, bark type, bark color, scienctific name, common name, and medicinal properties it holds and diseases it cures against will be listed.


### Target Audience(s) (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your target audience(s).

The target audience is someone who many want to find natural remedies to simple sicknesses such as a cold and injuries such as a cut.


### Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
> Review some existing catalog that are similar to yours. List the catalog's you reviewed here. Write a small reflection on how you might use the design patterns you identified in your review in your own catalog.

Plant Catalog by Monrovia: https://www.monrovia.com/plant-catalog/

The main goal of this catalog is to help customers find plants that not only will grow where the customer is located, but also meets their landscaping needs. If a plant is not available for sale online the catalog leads the user to other retailers that carry the plant.

* Provides two main ways of discovering plants
    + Using the common name
    + Using the botanical name
* Allows the user to filter for plants using various attributes such as plant type, water needs, landscape use, flowering season etc.
* Once a search is made pictures of the plants shop up in rows with it's common name, botanical name, item number on the catalog, and one good thing about the plant.
* When the user clicks on a certain plant more information about the plant, where it grows, it's care needs, and benefits are listed.

## Design & Planning (Milestone 2)

## Design Process (Milestone 2)
> Document your design process. Show us the evolution of your design from your first idea (sketch) to design you wish to implement (sketch). Show us the process you used to organize content and plan the navigation, if applicable.
> Label all images. All labels must be visible in VS Code's Markdown Preview.
> Clearly label the final design.


## Partials (Milestone 2)
> If you have any partials, plan them here.


## Database Schema (Milestone 2)
> Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this. Make sure you include constraints for each field.

Table: movies
- field 1: description..., constraints...
- field...


## Database Query Plan (Milestone 2)
> Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.]

1. All records

    ```

2. Search records

    ```
    TODO
    ```

3. Insert record

    ```
    TODO
    ```


## Code Planning (Milestone 2)
> Plan any PHP code you'll need here.


# Reflection (Final Submission)
